```
brew install glew
brew install glfw3
brew install freeimage
```

**on Windows:**
All dependencies are included in this repository. When running CMake, choose "Visual Studio xx WIN64" or choose "Visual Studio xx" as the target platform. In the second case, make sure to definitely choose x64 in the next field.

```
sudo apt-get install libglew-dev
sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev
sudo apt-get install libfreeimage3 libfreeimage-dev
